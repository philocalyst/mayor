    <section aria-label="Statement from Tracy Saunders, candidate for Mayor of Port Wentworth, GA">
      <p>
        On August 21, Tracy Saunders officially became a candidate for Mayor of Port
        Wentworth, GA.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am proud to be a resident of Port Wentworth and I believe I have what
        it takes to lead this city into a future of growth with respect for all the
        city&rsquo;s citizens,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more than 27 years, Tracy served as an educator for middle and high
        schools &mdash; the majority of those years within Chatham County. Tracy was
        selected as Teacher of the Year at Robert W. Groves High School. She attained her
        Masters of Education at the University of Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
        A citizen of Port Wentworth since 2017, Tracy has volunteered on the Citizens
        Input Council and the Zoning Appeals Board. Her exposure to this area through
        her decades of students and serving the city has given Tracy insight into the
        everyday lives of households big and small.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 1999, Tracy has been a resident within Chatham County. Together with her
        husband, Bill, they became parents with the adoption of six children, who now
        range in age from 14 to 33. They have also been blessed with the addition of
        nine grandchildren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tracy Saunders is a citizen, not a politician, and it is her belief that a
        citizen is exactly what Port Wentworth needs to lead it into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Like many of us today, my family struggles with our budget, watching what
        comes in and goes out and working hard to keep things rolling,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has been a tenacious advocate for her family and students, doing her best
        to make sure needs are met or exceeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same mindset I will take to City Hall &mdash; seeking
        what&rsquo;s best to keep Port Wentworth fair and sustainable for
        all,&rdquo; Tracy stated.
