      <section>
        <p>If you don&rsquo;t know what bioswales or rain gardens are, don&rsquo;t worry. I didn&rsquo;t either until a
          few months ago, when I started researching how to slow down the swamp that forms in my side yard every time it
          rains hard.</p>
        <p>It is Port Wentworth, after all. Most of us live barely above sea level, on land that used to be swampland.
          Water doesn&rsquo;t just visit&mdash;it settles in.</p>
        <p>When I decided to run for mayor, I started digging into what&rsquo;s called green infrastructure. Yes, the
          term sounds like something you&rsquo;d hear at a yoga retreat, but it&rsquo;s actually a smart, cost-effective
          urban planning tool. Green infrastructure means using nature&rsquo;s own systems&mdash;wetland plants,
          permeable surfaces, tree canopies&mdash;to manage water the way nature has for thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Native plants like cardinal flowers, yellow flag irises, creeping Jenny, and swamp white oaks don&rsquo;t
          just look good&mdash;they drink deeply. They absorb inches of water, not just drops. And they do it better
          than the manicured, decorative landscaping we often see.</p>
        <p>You can&rsquo;t mow down native foliage and expect the water to politely disappear. It doesn&rsquo;t. It
          floods yards, roads, and&mdash;this weekend&mdash;a respected equestrian center.</p>
        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the damage, take a look here. Washed-out paddocks, collapsed fencing, and horses
          and their owners displaced. It wasn&rsquo;t just a mess for them&mdash;it was a warning for the rest of us.
        </p>
        <p>And we&rsquo;re lucky it wasn&rsquo;t so much worse.</p>
        <p>There are solutions, but they require time, labor, and that all-important word: planning. Citizens need to
          maintain their ditches&mdash;even if they&rsquo;re technically in the city easement. That means cutting grass
          and clearing debris. Deeper digging is the city&rsquo;s job, but regular upkeep is ours.</p>
        <p>We also need to rethink landscaping. It should be functional, not just decorative. Thirsty plants along
          drainage areas can make a real difference. And for larger developments, municipalities must ask hard
          questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are developers preserving old-growth trees?</li>
          <li>Are they using both retention and detention ponds?</li>
          <li>Are surfaces permeable, allowing water to drain naturally?</li>
          <li>Are the grading and terracing correct or just fast and cheap?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Environmental planning isn&rsquo;t a political trend&mdash;it&rsquo;s basic science. Water is like a group of
          teenagers: without structure and somewhere to go, nothing good is going to happen.</p>
        <p>We saw that play out this weekend. And while it wasn&rsquo;t in Chatham County, it was close enough. These
          are our neighbors. Our classmates. Our teachers. Our families.</p>
        <p>With all the concrete packed into Port Wentworth&rsquo;s 16 square miles, we could be next. That&rsquo;s why
          every current and future development must answer one simple question: Where will the water go?</p>
        <p>Responsible resource management means using green infrastructure&mdash;not just to fix today&rsquo;s
          problems, but to prevent tomorrow&rsquo;s disasters.</p>
        <p>We should develop with foresight. We must plan with purpose.</p>
        <p>Citizens can work together to help mitigate small, local water problems. Elected officials should collaborate
          to make that happen.</p>
        <p>Elected officials who ask the right questions and are committed to making the right choices for the future of
          our communities&mdash;this is who our leaders need to be.</p>
        <p>If you want smart, responsible resource management, be sure to vote November 4. Vote like your home depends
          on it. Because it just might.</p>
        <p>Also, click here to support their GoFundMe. I know several people whose children took riding lessons there,
          and have nothing but praise for the work this family does.</p>
