        <h2>Building a Stronger Port Wentworth Together</h2>
        <p>Last year, my neighbor and friend, Councilwoman Artlisa Cone, came to me with an idea she wanted to
          try&mdash;the Citizen&rsquo;s Input Council.</p>
        <p>The concept is simple: pick one issue at a time, work it through from beginning to end, and see what real
          solutions we can create together.</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s what drew me in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A way for everyday citizens to get involved</li>
          <li>The chance to learn from professionals</li>
          <li>Just one meeting a month</li>
          <li>An opportunity to actually make things happen in our city</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>The first thing we did was brainstorm. What does Port Wentworth have going for it? What are we lacking as a
          city? So much information. We talked. We sorted. We labeled. And then we chose.</p>
        <p>Our first project took on something many families talk about&mdash;there aren&rsquo;t enough things for teens
          to do around here. As a mom of three current teenagers, I agree. After nearly a year of work, we had
          additional youth/teen programming through the Recreation Department and the formation of the Port Wentworth
          Youth Council.</p>
        <p>It feels good to see our ideas turning into action&mdash;and we&rsquo;re only just beginning.</p>

        <h2>Moving Forward: Green Space, Gardens &amp; History</h2>
        <p>At our August meeting, we looked at several issues and ideas in small groups, and in September moved forward
          with finding ways to incorporate more usable green space, community gardens, and a possible farmers market.
        </p>
        <p>We started with those ideas and moved into combining them with historic tourism.</p>
        <p>Once we started talking, some exciting connections started to show up.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Starting a regular farmer&rsquo;s market</li>
          <li>Turning unused spots in the city into gardens or green spaces everyone can enjoy</li>
          <li>Highlighting the farming history that&rsquo;s such a big part of our area</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That last point sparked a lot of ideas&mdash;about working with schools, colleges, and businesses to share
          the responsibility of whatever our final project ends up being. Are there grants that could help get things
          off the ground? How can community farming help lower grocery costs for families?</p>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of potential here, and we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface.</p>

        <h2>What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
        <p>Everyone left the meeting with homework&mdash;researching opportunities, gathering ideas, and looking for
          resources. We&rsquo;ll be back together on Friday, October 17, at 6:30 PM to share what we&rsquo;ve found and
          move closer to setting clear goals.</p>
        <p>The Citizen&rsquo;s Input Council is still in the very beginning of working this issue. This is the time when
          new people can jump in and really help shape where things go.</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re interested, please reach out to me or Councilwoman Cone. We&rsquo;d love to have you join the
          conversation.</p>

        <h2>A Personal Note</h2>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve been following my campaign, you know I believe in building a Port Wentworth where everyone
          has a voice. Sharing updates like this takes time and resources, so if you like what I&rsquo;m doing and want
          to see more, I&rsquo;d be grateful for your support. Every contribution helps us keep moving forward.</p>
        <p>Thank you for believing in our city and what we can accomplish together.</p>
